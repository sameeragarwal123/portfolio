# Portfolio

This repository contains the source for my personal portfolio website hosted on GitHub Pages.

## How to view

Visit `https://<your-username>.github.io/portfolio/` once published.

To view locally, simply open `index.html` in a browser. It pulls in Tailwind CSS from a CDN so no build step is required.
